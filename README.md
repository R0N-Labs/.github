# 🧠 R0N-Labs

**Rust Orchestration Network** — Building the future of distributed automation, powered by Rust ⚙️

---

### 🌐 About Us

R0N-Labs is an independent research and development initiative focused on creating **high-performance orchestration**, **automation**, and **infrastructure tools** built with Rust.  
We aim to empower developers, sysadmins, and AI-driven systems with scalable, efficient, and modular software that bridges local execution and distributed intelligence.

Our projects are designed with:
- 🦀 **Rust-first performance and safety**
- 🌍 **Cross-platform orchestration**
- ⚡ **Low latency, high throughput**
- 🧩 **Extensible, modular architecture**

---

### 🚀 Core Project — R0N

**R0N** (Rust Orchestration Network) is a next-generation automation and orchestration platform.

It combines:
- **Agent-based distributed execution**
- **Declarative configuration and environment management**
- **Local + cloud hybrid control plane**
- **Self-updating infrastructure**
- **Integration with container, VM, and edge environments**

**Tech stack:**
- **Frontend:** Flutter (Web + Mobile)
- **Backend:** Rust (Actix/Axum + Tokio)
- **Database:** NoSQL (MongoDB / SurrealDB)
- **Orchestration:** QEMU, Docker/Podman, and WASM-compatible runtimes

### 💡 Vision

> To create a seamless orchestration layer that allows applications, services, and agents to run anywhere — securely, efficiently, and autonomously.

### 🧩 Open vs Enterprise

| Feature | Community Edition | Enterprise Suite |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Core Orchestration Engine | ✅ | ✅ |
| Flutter-based Dashboard | ✅ | ✅ |
| Cloud Sync and Collaboration | ❌ | ✅ |
| Multi-node Deployment | ✅ | ✅ |
| AI-driven Optimization | ❌ | ✅ |
| Enterprise Support | ❌ | ✅ |

We believe in **open development** — core functionality will always remain **free and open source** under a permissive license.
